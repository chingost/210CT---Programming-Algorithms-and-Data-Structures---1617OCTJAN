Random Shuffle
a.	 Does your algorithm have defined inputs and outputs? 
Yes it will only take integers and produces there is a try/except in case any other type if given
b.	Can you guarantee that it terminates? 
Yes, for loop working in each range once the specified iterations are run it returns result
c.	Is it specified in a clear and concise manner? 
yes
d.	Does your algorithm produce the correct result for all instances?
Yes, works for all positive and negative integers tested

Zeroes
a.	 Does your algorithm have defined inputs and outputs? 
    yes 
b.	Can you guarantee that it terminates? 
    yes, there is a base case which is evaluated at the start of each iteration
c.	Is it specified in a clear and concise manner? 
    yes
d.	Does your algorithm produce the correct result for all instances?
    yes, for all instances of float and int tested as well as positive and negative values
